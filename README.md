# ScrollControl
## A library for tracking and reacting to scroll position.

This is stripped from a project I'm currently working on. Right now it's got all sorts of dependencies. 

### To Do:
- Remove dependency on Javascript
- Remove any existing code that is specific to the source project
- Take all project dependencies and make them assignable by the developer
